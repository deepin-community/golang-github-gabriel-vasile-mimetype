License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
      this License.
 .
   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
      sale or other transfer of ownership.
 .
   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
      of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
      lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
      expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
      applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
      three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.
 .
   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.
 .
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
      by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
      public digital performances; to make available to the public
      Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
      Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
      to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and
      the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
      including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
      images.
 .
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
      digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;
 .
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
        i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
           jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
           through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
           be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
           collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
           rights granted under this License;
 .
       ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
           in which the right to collect royalties through any
           statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
           Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
           royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
           under this License; and,
 .
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
           collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
           that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
           administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
           from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
           License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
 now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
 rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
 rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.
 .
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.
 .
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.
 .
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.
 .
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
      wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
 extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
 Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 .
 Section 1 -- Definitions.
 .
   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
      synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 .
   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
      Rights.
 .
   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
      agreements.
 .
   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
      License.
 .
   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
      under this Public License.
 .
   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
      available to the public including in ways that members of the
      public may access the material from a place and at a time
      individually chosen by them.
 .
   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
        the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
          a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
         in part; and
 .
          b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
        License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
        its terms and conditions.
 .
     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
        6(a).
 .
     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
        all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
        and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
        necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
        simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
        (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
     5. Downstream recipients.
 .
          a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
         recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
         receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
         Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
         Public License.
 .
          b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
         any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
         apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
         Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
         Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
         Material.
 .
     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
        may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
        are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
        with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
        the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
        provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
        licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
        the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
        assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
        extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
        Public License.
 .
     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
        under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
        reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
        form), You must:
 .
          a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
         with the Licensed Material:
 .
           i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
              Material and any others designated to receive
              attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
              the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
              designated);
 .
          ii. a copyright notice;
 .
         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
          iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
              warranties;
 .
           v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
              extent reasonably practicable;
 .
          b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
         retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
          c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
         Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
         hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
        reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
        information.
 .
     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
        information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
        reasonably practicable.
 .
     4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
        License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
        Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
        violation; or
 .
     2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .

 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 .
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font
    name as presented to the users.
 .
 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
    Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
    permission.
 .
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created
    using the Font Software.
